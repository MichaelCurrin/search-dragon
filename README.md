## Documentation

### Set up and run locally

How to run the web app locally. No need for Node or NPM!

1. Clone this original repo or your copy of the repo.
    ```sh
    $ git clone it@github.com:MichaelCurrin/search-dragon.git
    ```
2. Start a static server in the repo root. See recommended server options in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/1a6116a4e0918c8468dc7e1a701a5f95).
3. Open the browser at your localhost address.

For a dev version of Vue with better debugging but a larger file to download, use `vue.esm-browser.js` instead of `vue.esm-browser.prod.js` in [main.js](/main.js).

### Deploy

1. Go to your repo's _Settings_.
2. Enable _GitHub Pages_.
3. After a few seconds, open your site deployed at `MyUsername.github.io/search-dragon`.

To make changes, push commits to GitHub and after a few seconds you can refresh your site and see the results.
